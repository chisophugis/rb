Parent pointers vs. no parent pointers

Recursive implementation vs non-recursive implementation

2-3 vs. 2-3-4 vs. Left-Leaning-2-3-4

Store which child we are? I think it would only require changes to the
rotate routines. This would allow you to do most of the insert routine with
almost no branches.
The "which child am I" bit:
- Can always be computed branchlessly from context
- Only needs to change when the parent pointer changes, so no extra memory
  accesses or monkey business.
- Should probably be the lowest bit.
(can rename `rb_parent_color` to `rb_parent_color_which`)


What order to put the fields in the struct?

restructure on the way down?

during deletion, if the only child is red, then we can swap colors with it
and get away without having to rebalance.

introduce a little bit of randomness into whether we find predecessor or
successor when deleting an interior black node.
