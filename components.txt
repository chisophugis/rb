+ Brutal test suite. Should quickly identify any incorrect implementation.

+ Tools for visualizing stuff.

+ Detailed bounds for each function.

+ Comprehensive performance tests with a clear architecture and easy way to
plug in another implementation for testing.

+ Be able to independently change how the red-black tree nodes are
allocated in the performance tests to prevent cache effects from
confounding the results.

+ Look at `kazlib` in the bestiary and look at its main function in the .c
file. Note how it has a mini command language that you can use to
manipulate the trees from the command line. I like that idea.

+ Annotated bibliography of relevant papers and resources.
