If we store which child each node is, then we can do case 2 and case 3 of
insertion with fewer memory accesses. Some (a lot?) of the work that we do
in case 2 get "overwritten" on falling into case 3. We should be able to
(more-or-less) branchlessly perform all of the necessary restructurings in
both case 2+3 and case 3.
